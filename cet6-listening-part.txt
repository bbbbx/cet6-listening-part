Oh. Hi, there. A beauty, isn't she? Do you want to take her for a test ride?
Well…Um. How old is It?
Well, it’s only three years old
And what's the mileage?
Uh, let me check. Oh, yes. 75, 000 miles
75,000 miles? That is quite a bit for a car that's only three years old.
Well, once you're in the driver's seat, you'll fall in love with her. Get in
Ugh.Uh,I can't seem to get the door open. It could be broken
Ah, just give her a little tap. Now she's opened
Great. a door i have to beat up to open.
Hey. Get in and start her up.
Oh, there seems to be something wrong.
Well, it's probably the battery i know she has enough gas in her, and I had our mechanic
check her out just yesterday. Try it again.
Okay. How much is this anyway?
Oh. it's a real bargain today and tomorrow only at $ 15, 775, plus you get the extended
warranty for an extra 500 for the next 30, 000 miles
Uh. Well, almost 16, 000 is a little out of my price range, plus the seat covers are torn a little
Well, hey,I might be able to talk the manager into lowering the price another 200
but that's about all
No, thanks. I think i'll just keep looking

Good morning. Today we'll talk about goal-setting and we have a special guest here, Kate
Warwick. Welcome to our program, Mrs. Warwick.
Thank you
So Mrs. Warwick, can you tell us about your work in goal-setting?
OK. When it comes to goal-setting, i'm really focused. For example, if i want to lose
weight, I will get a group of friends around me and tell them i want to lose weight and
increase my health. Then Ill take actions to achieve this goal by refraining from eating poor
Well, why do you gather some close friends together
It is important for me because I need support. I know I cant do it on my own. Also it
helps because i am able to share my problems with them. And by telling other people, I
really want to do this and i seek your help, they can keep you honest i suppose
So setting goals helps people achieve something But is there anything negative about goal-
setting
Yes. If you set yourself a goal and you re so focused on it, then you will be close-minded
to other things that happen
Why is it that most people do so badly at reaching goals?
 They lose focus. everybody' s life is busy. There is so much happening in everybody's
life that what happens is that they might have a goal, and then something will get in the
road of that
Once you reach a goal, what's the next step?
One thing that i would strongly encourage is to celebrate success. Once you have made
and reached that level, it is a real must to celebrate it. That way you are acknowledging it
to yourself, and you re acknowledging this level of achievement

Thank you for calling the University Career Management Centre UCMC. The University
Career Management Centre provides information, programs and services to help students in
developing, refining and implementing their career objectives. UCMC Information Centre
contains occupational, employer and graduate school information and comprehensive computeraided career planning and placement support. UCMC also operates two programs which will provide students with out-of-the-classroom experiences in the marketplace and working fields
connected with their majors.  The cooperative education program, which is paid, gives
students access to on-going professional experience with business, industry and government and
enables students to receive from two to four semesters of actual on-the-job training directly
related to their fields of study. The internship program differs from cooperative education program in that it generally is part-time, temporary work, which may be either paid or non paid. The purpose of internship is to help students to meet their educational and personal
expenses while they are in school. In addition, UCMC administers two services the graduate
student service and the international student service. The graduate student service offers
opportunities for students to begin finalizing their post-graduation plans and to make successful
transitions from school to work. during the academic year, employers from business, industry
and government visit UCMC to interview graduating students who are seeking employment.
 The international student service provides opportunities for students to familiarize
employment policies, job search techniques and the job markets

a team of scientists recently began a project to measure the effects of loud noises on sea
animals. If the sounds don't harm the animals, then the researchers can go ahead with a plan to
transmit sound waves through the pacific Ocean to take the earths temperature Sound travels
faster through warm water than cold water. By analyzing the speed of sound through the
ocean over time, the scientists will be able to determine if our planet is warming up.The
experiment was nearly cancelled more than a year ago because environmental groups fear that
the sound will confuse or harm sea animals. So scientists are conducting tests on the animals
first. The researchers lowered a loud speaker that emits low frequency sound about 1,000
meters beneath the ocean. Scientists at the site transmit sound waves into the ocean. Radio
transmitters attached to some of the sea animals help the researchers keep track of the animals
movements. If sea animals are distressed by the sounds, they would swim away from the
speakers. So far, there aren't any signs that the animals are being harmed. Researchers at the
site noticed that large numbers of sea animals swim near the speaker whether it was turned
on or off, but it is still too soon to know for sure, the scientists admit The tests will continue
through September. If all goes well, they say, we can begin measuring temperature changes
on our planet.

Hello, ladies and gentlemen. It gives me great pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker
for today' s session, Dr. Peter Lake. Dr. Lake, professor of sociology at Washington
University, has written numerous articles and books on how to seize more opportunities in your
daily life.
Dr. lake
it's sometimes one of the scariest words in English language, but it's a word you should be
prepared to say when opportunities arise in your career: Yes.
i' m not saying you should blindly accept everything thats offered to you, it's okay to take
time when considering the pros and cons of an opportunity. But, when you find yourself
leaning toward "No, you owe it to yourself to be sure that you're turning down the
opportunity for a valid reason, not just out of fear.
Consider this Will the experience enhance your knowledge and play to your strengths?
Will it introduce you to new concepts and new people? Will it require you to develop new
techniques for managing your team or working with more experienced people? Embrace this
challenge and get out of your comfort zone
When i find myself wanting to shout "No! to an opportunity, that's a sure sign to me
that the answer should probably be "Yes". So, i take a deep breath and analyze the situation as
objectively as possible.
Remember, no one is ever perfectly prepared for every situation. You’ve probably
discovered this by now. Your education gave you a foundation for the job, but growth
happens in the trenches. Maybe you motivated your team not just to meet the new deadline, but
to deliver extraordinary work. Perhaps you realized you had more poise than you ever expected
in a client situation. Or, you suddenly discovered that you can capitalize on the relationships
you've built and become a "rainmaker for your organization. Before you can learn any of these
things, you have to learn to say "Yes". it's okay to acknowledge the butterflies in your
stomach; however, it's not okay to let them stifle your growth
 When you need help, reach out to people in your networks- that's what they re
there for. Whether you need a confidence-boosting pep talk or advice about building your
technical experience- your mentor, your colleagues, and your manager can help. You may not
know how to do something today, but chances are you're smart enough to find someone who
can help you learn it. And once you do, don't unfasten your seatbelt- there's always going to
be another challenge headed your way.
Thats all for the speech. Thank you!

Good morning, everyone. I feel honored to be here. Can you really make new friends as an
adult? I mean, there's plenty of advice out there on how to help kids make friends. But if you
don’t have friends by the time you re an adult, it seems the world hands you a dunce cap and
shows you to the corner
After all, many adults have all the friends they need or want, right? People get married
have kids and have little time for others outside their family. does that make it harder to meet
new people after a certain age?
Well, yes and no. It depends on your geographic location. Yes, many people "settle
down"after a certain age. But not everyone And while it may take a little more time to " warm
up to a new friend as an adult, it can certainly be done.
In fact, many of the techniques kids instinctively use to make friends on the playground
work for ages 4 through 104. So here are some habits of highly social children that can help you
make fi
lends
First of all, leverage current social assets
I remember back in Kindergarten, I would make friends through other friends. One friend might
have a birthday party where Id meet other kids. Some would become new friends. it's not quite as easy
as an adult, but the same principle applies. first ask yourself, who are you already around on a normal
basis? This might include current friends, coworkers, family members
Then, be aware of invites from these social assets"and say yes to birthday parties, reunions, holiday events, after work drinks, company picnics, etc. At these events, you'll
likely meet new people who are friends of friends or family
Also, go to interest groups, not bars.
Some kids are really active going to gymnastics, band, theater and more. Ideally, these are
activities the kids enjoy. And there lies the magic. You have a group of kids, all doing
something they love, together. Thats where the bonding comes. there's seldom any shared
activity or interest in a bar.  The common thread in bars, if there is any, is people go there
to socialize So, the greatest "socializers"win. If you aren't that comfortable socializing, you
strike out. Instead, why not go somewhere you know the people will share your interests? For
example, if you're interested in writing, it's a good bet members in a writers group will be too
So you have an instant connection with them and a built in topic to start conversations
Hope you enjoy todays lecture. Thank you!

Hello, everyone It is my great honor to give a speech here. In previous speeches we have
shared our experience regarding the use of storytelling as one of the most powerful leadership
tools available to modern leaders.  it's really no surprise, since leaders throughout the ages
have used personal stories, parables and anecdotes effectively to ensure that listeners could
easily absorb and integrate information, knowledge, values and strategies.
Except merely understanding the power of stories, however, there remains the need for
specific action and commitment to become a storyteller I hear people say: Sure, i can see your
point about telling stories . but do i really need to make the effort to become a storyteller
myself? It doesn’t seem to come naturally to me.  My answer is always something like
Yes, I understand. And there was also a time when walking, reading and writing, typing and
using a computer program seemed unnatural. but when you clearly understood why' learning
these skills was worth the time, you simply got busy and did it. Right?
So in this speech i want to remind you of the compelling reasons why it is worth your time
to become an effective storyteller, in the hopes that more managers and leaders will just get
busy learning to tell stories instead of just spewing out information, directives and platitudes.
Here are some of the many reasons why it is so worth it for you to decide, today, to become a
great storyteller.
First, people remember and share stories. The human brain is actually structured to retain
memories in story format, with a beginning, middle and end.  Long after listeners have
forgotten your data, they will remember your story, and the wisdom embedded within it. And
if your story is authentic and compelling they will eagerly share it with others. Many leadership
stories from your personal experience even have the potential to go viral, taking on a life of
their own, spreading far and wide in your organization or social networks Second, stories engage all the senses, memories and the emotions. Try this now,
following my instructions exactly I now forbid you to imagine a purple elephant. I repeat: Do
not think of a purple elephant right now. Further, I forbid you to imagine a purple elephant on
roller skates, whizzing down a mountain road at 100 km per hour, with a bright red scarf
around its' neck, streaming behind it in the breeze. and do not imagine the blissful smile on the
purple elephant's face as it goes whizzing down the mountain, freedom of the ride
Ok, how did you do? The fact is, once you hear my words, I instantly engaged your
imagination and you have installed a purple elephant in your imagination. at the same time
you have accessed your own memories of moving at high speed feeling joyful, bright red and
purple colors. Stories are immediate, engaging and irresistible. I told you the story, but you
created it in your own imagination, and you now own it. Perhaps you even smiled as you had
fun doing this
Start telling stories! Stories can transform your relationships with people and make you a stand-out leader. So go for it.

Id like to go to the States, but if i took the job there, i wont get a very good salary.
Really? i thought salaries were high there, but there would be some fringe benefits presumably.
Oh, yes. It would be stimulating and it has some advantages
What else do you have in mind?
Well, this position in Portugal
How does it compare?
It offers greatest security, because it will be on a home-base contract.
And salary?
Much better. i get an overseas allowance plus free accommodation from the firm
Presumably you will be given moving expenses for the Portugal job?
Yes, but just to complicate matters, this possibility offers a post in Sao Paulo
that's Brazil, isn’t it?
Yes. And  i'll get a promotion if i took a post there.
Id love to go to brazil
But there are some disadvantages.  i'd have to do a five-year term there
Thats not a problem, surely?
Well, not at the moment.  But if there were a change in family circumstances, i'd be a
long way from home.
But if you worry about distance, isn’t that the same problem with the States?
Yes, but in the States i will be on an annual contract, so i can leave fairly quickly if i needed to
n Portuga
Well, thats almost next door, isn’t it? i can visit home every a few months if necessary.
I can see you've got a difficult choice to make
Well, fortunately i don’t have to make up my mind about any of them yet. In fact, I haven’t even been called for an interview.

What is it, Bob?  You sounded pretty serious on the phone. Have we still got budget
problem?
I don’t know. I hope not. The meetings on Friday. but that's not what i want to talk to you
about. Er. close the door, will you? it's Marsha
Marsha? What about her?
I am worried. I don't know what to do. She is just not performing. We may have to let
er go.
Fire her? She’s been with us a long time, Bob. If she leaves, it will be a big loss to us
She’s done really excellent work
Yes. But, lately, the last month or so, in fact, there've been a lot of problems. She’s
changed. Not only does she have a tendency to be moody all the time, but she misses appointments, doesn’t follow through on projects and doesn’t seem to plan anything till the
last minute
E
mmm
Did she ever explain why she didn’t show up for the Denver trip?
No, she said she was sorry and it wouldn’t happen again.  Something about her mixed up
on the arrangements to get to the airport. now whenever anybody mentions the subject to
her, she just goes silent. i don’t know. Thank Goodness. David pulled us out of the hole on
that one
Yes, he did a really fine job- filling in for Marsha like that at the last minute.
i don't think it was the first time he has to do that. If we knew all the facts, I think
we'll find that he's been covering for Marsha on quite a few projects

Larry arrived early for his speaking engagement. He positioned the table so that he could
move close to the audience at strategic points in the speech. he had read that  speakers can
be more persuasive if they invade the personal space of listeners, encouraging an emotional
response. For the same reason, he placed the chairs close to each other, and raised the
temperature to a slightly uncomfortable level.  The purpose of the speech was to encourage
the audience of cooperate executives and local business owners to support local sports groups
To enhance his credibility with the audience, Larry had brought some slides of his family
attending sports events. One photo showed him at an award ceremony where he had been
honored for his financial contribution to a local baseball team. realizing that this particular
audience would find his regional accent unattractive, Larry planned to speak with an accent that
would be more acceptable to his audience.  After reading a book on how to dress for
success, he had purchased an expensive dark navy suit and golden tie. He chose colors and
styles known to communicate power and influence Just before people began entering the hall,  Larry dimmed the lights and turned up the sound system, which was playing soft music
hoping to create a warm personal atmosphere for the speech. he hoped that these added facts
would encourage his audience to support local sports teams. he had also planned the content of
his speech to focus on the teams with the best records, the ones that had won the most games
in the last season.

Phillis Wheatley was a young African-American slave who belonged to land owner John
Wheatley in Colonial America.  She was also a poet and the first African-American ever to
publish a book. her poems on various subjects
was printed in Boston in
1773, three years before the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
Early salves were generally denied education, but Wheatley was allowed by her owner to
study poetry, Latin and the bible, and by the time she reached her late teens, she had written
enough poetry to put together a slender book of verse. Even so, publication was difficult. 
The publisher, fearful of being cheated, forced her to submit to a scholarly examination by a
board of educated men, including the colonial governor. The board of judges questioned
Wheatley extensively and ruled that she was educated enough to have written the book. Only
then was publication permitted
Wheatley may have been the first, but she was not the only slave to write a book during
the growing days of the republic. Unfortunately, most of the early popular African-American writers have been all but forgotten in modem times until now. A Cornell professor, Henry
Louis gates, recently started a research project looking into nineteen-century African-American fiction and poetry.  Jin the process, he uncovered numerous lost works, almost half of which
were written by African-American women. In varied literary styles, the newly resurfaced
manuscripts offered a rich stock of African-American culture, recreating among other thing
the early days of slavery and the importance of religion to the slaves.

Hello everybody, I am happy to introduce our admirable speaker for today' s lecture, Dr.
Brick Blue. Dr. Blue, Professor of Management at Columbia University,  has written
numbers of articles and books on the topic of making holidays more meaningful in recent years
which is helpful especially to those who are too busy to make perfect private plans. Welcome
Dr. Blue.
Hello, everyone Have you ever thought of making your holidays more meaningful? Well
here is some advice for you
it's hard to focus on the true meaning of the holidays when you re rushing from one
shopping mall to the next. Try this Six to ten weeks before the holiday season, sketch out a
weekly calendar with all your holiday obligations- then start eliminating Weed out and
delegate as much as you can; you ll free up more time for real connecting
it's better to give than to receive- and that applies to more than material goods.
Some
ways to spread cheer to those in need Help your kids deliver homemade holiday cookies to a
retirement home, schedule a visit to the children’s cancer ward at a local hospital to deliver
baskets of toys, help serve a holiday meal at a homeless shelter.
How much money does your family spend on"meaningless"food- soft drinks, chips,
cookies and the like? Reexamine your food choices and buying patterns, and pass the savings
on: Calculate how much you spend on junk food and gift that money to a charity, or donate 2
percent of your food purchases to a food bank.
Rituals anchor holidays, and give kids a sense of continuity and a tradition they can pass on
for years to come.  It can be as simple as lighting candles, singing songs, or saying a special
prayer. Other ideas Take a holiday hike in the woods, throw a lake party, host an annual
holiday dessert potluck
it's never too early to teach kids to share. Explain to your children that not all boys and
girls have gifts to open on the holidays, and ask if they d like to share some of theirs. Most kids
are eager to pick out and wrap old favorites,  especially if they’re involved in delivering
them to the recipients. Sharing toys goes for grown-ups as well: Old computers, golf clubs
CD players or cell phones are meaningful holiday donations
You cant stop holiday commercialism, but you can refuse to partake. Kill your television
and engage kids and family in more festive activities give kids disposable cameras and have an
afternoon of photo-taking; make cookies for an assisted living center; head to the local ice rink
museum or aquarium; drag out the markers and paints and make homemade New years cards
Instead of supporting plastics, box stores and rampant consumerism, make gifts more
meaningful. Buy at small, local stores; make your own holiday cards and donate the savings to
charity.
 As much as you want to connect with your family and friends, it's essential to carve
out time for yourself even if it's just 10 minutes a day. Take time for meditation,
introspection, yoga, a solitary hike, gazing at the evening stars. when days get busy and
stressful, schedule an afternoon siesta during which everyone goes to his or her room for 45
minutes to read, nap and play quietly. Lock yourself in the bathroom with a hot bath, and don’t
wait until New Years Day to rethink your personal priorities- list them now and let the magic
f the holidays inspire you
I hope you will enjoy your holidays better after today's talk. Thank you very much.

Green is an important color in nature. It is the color of grass and the leaves on trees.It
is also the color of most growing plants.  Sometimes, the word"green"means young, fresh
and growing. Sometimes, it describes something that is not yet ripe or finished.
For example,  a greenhorn is someone who has no experience, who is new to a situation. In the 15th century, a greenhorn was a young cow or ox whose horns had not yet developed. A century or so later, a greenhorn was a soldier who had not yet had any experience in
battle. By the 18th century,  a greenhorn had the meaning it has today - a person who is
new in a 1o
Green is also the color used to describe the powerful emotion, jealousy The green-eyed
monster is not a frightening creature from outer space.  It is an expression used about 400
years ago by British writer William Shakespeare in his play. It describes the unpleasant
feeling a person has when someone has something he wants. a young man may suffer from the
green-eyed monster if his girlfriend begins going out with someone else. Or, that green-eyed monster may affect your friend if you get a pay raise and she does not
In most places in the world, a green light is a sign to move ahead. a green light on a traffic
signal means your car can continue on. In everyday speech, a green light means approval to continue with a project. We want you to know we have a green light to continue this series next week.

The first magazine was a little periodical called the
and it was started in London
in 1704. It looked a lot like the newspapers of the time But in terms of its content, it was much
different Newspapers were concerned mainly with news events, but the focused
on important domestic issues of the day, as well as the policies of the government. Now in
England at the time, people could still be thrown in jail for publishing articles that were critical
of the king. And thats what happened to Daniel Defoe. He was the outspoken founder of the
Review. Defoe actually wrote the first issue of the
from prison. You see,  he had
been arrested because of his writings that criticized the policies of the Church of England which was headed by the king. After his release, Defoe continued to produce the
and the
magazine started to appear on a more frequent schedule, about three times a week. It didn’t take
long for other magazines to start popping up. In 1709, a magazine called the
began
publication. This new magazine contained a mixture of news, poetry, political analysis, and
philosophical essays.

So, possible locations for the plant. First, the basic facilities for the region are generally
very good, at least between the three main cities, Bilbao, Victoria in the south and san
Sebastian. There is now a fast train link to the south of France and to the rest of Spain
Although improvements affect Bilbao principally, but the whole region benefits. First, the
port area has been completely modernized and relocated. And airport has also been
extended.  So the basic facilities are good
Right. So, are we in a position to choose one of these cities?
Well, let's not rush into anything. i think it'l be a bad idea to assume were going to
choose a city. It might be better to think about one of the smaller towns
Smaller places. Yes. So, should we get details on the possible places?
Yes. We could do that. But, we need, i think, first, to check a few things, for example
tax benefits, grants, and anything like that. For locating to a smaller place, not one of the
main cities, then we can make a better decision
Yes, I agree. you've talked about the improved transport links in Bilbao. What about the links to the smaller towns? If it's a mountainous or hilly region, it could take an hour or
more for a truck to reach a main road.  So i think we need to look specifically at the train
and road links for smaller towns.
Yes. you're right. Road and rail, and financial position.

Well, before we decide were going to live in Enderby, we really ought to have a look at
the schools; we want the children to have a good secondary education, so we'd better see
what's available
They gave me some information at the district office and i took notes It appears there are
five secondary schools in Enderby: three state schools and two private.
i don’t know if we want private schools, do we?
i don’t think so, but we'll look at them anyway. Theres Saint Mary's, that's a Catholic school
or girls, and Carlton abbey-that's a very old boys boarding school, founded in 1672
Are all the state schools coeducational?
Yes, it seems so
 I think little Keith is going to be very good with his hands, we ought to send him to a
school with good vocational training-carpentry, electronics, that sort of thing
In that case we are best off at Enderby Comprehensive i gather they have excellent
workshops and instructors. But it says here that Donwell also has good facilities. Enderby
High has a little, but they are mostly academic. No vocational training at all at Carlton
Abbey or saint Marys.
What are the schools like academically? How many children go on to university every year?
Well, Enderby High is very good-and Carlton Abbey even better, 70% of their pupils
go on to university. Donwell isn't so good. Only 8%. And Enderby Comprehensive in Saint
Mary not much more, about 10%
Well, it seems like there is a broad selection of schools. But we have to find out more
than statistics before we can decide.

Would you trust a robot to park your car? The question will confront New Yorkers in
February as the city's first robotic parking opens in Chinatown.  The technology has been
successfully applied overseas, but the only other public robotic garage in the United States has
been troublesome, dropping vehicles and trapping cars because of technical problems.
 Nonetheless, the developers of the Chinatown garage are confident with the
technology and are counting on it to squeeze 67 cars in an apartment- building basement that
would otherwise fit only 24, accomplished by removing a maneuver space normally required
a human-shaped robot wont be stepping into your car to drive it.
Rather, the garage itself does the parking. The driver stops the car on a flat platform and
gets out. The platform is lowered into the garage, and it is then transported to a vacant parking
space by a computer-controlled device similar to an elevator that also runs sideways.
 There is no human supervision, but an attendant will be on hand to accept cash and
explain the system to new users
Parking rates will be attracted about 400 monthly or 25 per day, according to Ari
Milstein, the director of planning for Automation Parking Systems, which is the U. S.
subsidiary of a german company. This company has built automated garages in several countries overseas and in the United States for residents of a Washington, D. C. apartment
building.

A recent study shows that meat consumption is one of the main ways that human can
damage the environment, second only to the use of motor vehicles.
So how can eating meat have a negative effect on the environment? For a start, all
animals, such as cows, pigs and sheep, release a gas named methane, which is the second
common greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide Many environmental experts now believe that
methane is more responsible for global warming than carbon dioxide. It is estimated that 25%
of all methane released into the atmosphere comes from farm animals.
Another way in which meat production affects the environment is through the use of water
and land. 2, 500 gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of beef, whereas 20 gallons of
water are needed to produce one pound of wheat. One acre of farmland used for raising cows can
produce 250 pounds of beef. One acre of farmland used for crop production can produce 50,000
pounds of tomatoes. Many people now see the benefits of switching to a vegetarian diet which
excludes meat and fish, not just for health reasons, but also because it plays a vital role in
protecting the environment. However, some nutritionists advise against switching to a
totally strict vegetarian diet They believe such a diet which includes no products from animal
sources can be deficient in many of the necessary vitamins and minerals our bodies need
 Today many people have come to realize that to help the environment and for the
human race to survive, more of us will need to become vegetarian.

Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Welcome to the lecture, and
todays speaker is known for her work in evaluation of price and price policy. I would like to
introduce Dr. Abby King, Professor of Business at University of Pennsylvania. Now let
welcome
Dr. King.
Dr. King
Thank you for that introduction. Today we'll talk about how companies determine the
initial prices for their products. Uh, by that i mean when they first introduce the products in
the market. There’re different approaches and today we'll discuss two of them they're quite
different, each with their own advantages
One approach, or strategy, sets the initial price of the product high followed by a lower
price at a later stage Why? Well, when introducing a new product, companies want to
build a high quality image for it. Products that cost more are believed to be of higher quality
So, during the early stages of the product life cycle, companies can make very high profits from
consumer's willing to pay more for a high quality product, and although consumers know that
price will eventually do down, they’re also willing to pay more to get the product sooner. This
approach works very well with, oh, innovative high-tech products, for example. Now just
think about when video recorders or video cameras or even cell phones first came out. They
were very expensive. But then they became much more accessible.
Another very common strategy sets the initial price low.Now this happens when the
market is already saturates with the product and the strategy is to undercut its competitors
Say, theres a newly starting computer maker trying to gain market share. So what did
they do? Well, they offered a computer at an affordable price, lower than existing brands. b
doing this, the company appeals to new consumers who weren’t probably even interested in
getting a computer. And, well, of course, to existing consumers who might now be tempted to
switch brands. Now how does this company make profits with its low-priced computers? Well
one thing that' s often done is to encourage their customers to buy accessories also manufactured
by them, like printers or software, for example.

When people are in difficult situations sometimes they experience feelings of helplessness
or psychological pain. So what do they do?  They unconsciously use a strategy called
defense mechanisms, to protect themselves psychologically from their painful emotions.
Oh, let's say a woman has a pet dog. she's had this dog for a long time and he’s kept her
company and guarded her for years. But one day he runs away. This woman looks everywhere and asks other people if they've seen her dog but she just cant find him. Now, she feels
helpless and sad because she misses her dog So she'll unconsciously find ways to deal with her
painful feelings.
One defense mechanism she might use is fantasy. With fantasy, the woman uses her
imagination so instead of just feeling helpless and sad about her lost dog, she invents a happy
story in her mind. She might imagine that, uh, a nice family found him and feeds him and that
he's really happy with them. she'll picture the dog playing, running around, having fun.
Because of this fantasy, she doesn't have to feel sad about her dog running away it's a fantasy
it's not real, but it keeps her pain away.
Another defense mechanism she might use is what we call, sublimation. Sublimation is
different from fantasy because sublimation isn’t about pretending. it's about turning
negative emotions into something useful, practical. So, uh, the woman might start a dog
training school. That way, by training dogs, perhaps she can help prevent other people' s dogs
from running away like hers did. In other words, with sublimation as a defense mechanism, the
woman redirects her negative feelings about losing her dog into a positive, constructive activity.

Birds have some of the best vision capabilities in the animal kingdom. Some birds species have vision
that is eight to ten times greater than humans. Overall a bird s eyes are extremely important for its
survival
One aspect of bird 's eyes that plays a role in helping them survive, in other words to find food or to
avoid predators, is the position of the eyes in the skull,  Some birds have eyes that face forward on the
skull, kind of similar to how humans eyes are positioned. Forward facing eyes allow a bird to clearly see
and judge distances because it can focus on objects with both of its eyes, and correctly perceive height
width and depth. One type of bird with eyes positioned in the front of the skull is the hawk. Hawks eat
animals like mice. Hawks have such good eye sight that they can spot a tiny mouse in the field from high
up in the air. They spot the mouse and swoop down to catch it without such good eye sight, they would
not be able to spot or catch their food.
Other birds have eyes that are located on each side of the skull. This positioning of the eyes can
help a bird to avoid predators.  Instead of just seeing what's directly in front, they can see things that
are on either side, permitting them to watch for danger in all directions. Imagine a duck wading near the
edge of a lake. It needs to spend time eating grasses and insects, but it also is on constant lookout for
danger from its predator, like the fox. An eye on each side of the ducks head allows it to see a fox
approaching from either side. If it spots a fox, it can then fly away to safety The placement of the eyes
are critical in helping the duck avoid predators.

Hello Jane.
W. Hello paul
Please coming. Im just getting ready to go home. Susan is expecting me for dinner. I
wanted to be on time for a change.
Look, I’m terribly sorry to drop in this time on Friday, Paul, but it is rather
Important
That’s OK. what's the problem?
Well, Paul, i wont keep you long. You see there is a problem with the exchange rates. The
Indian Rupee has taken a fall on the foreign exchange market.  You see there is being a
sharp increase in Indian's balance of payment deficit.
I see. that's serious, isn't it?
Well, as you know, there have been reports of unrest India, and the prospects for the
Rupee look pretty gloomy
And that's going to affect us, as if we didn’t have enough problems on our hands.
So i thought it would be wise to take out forward exchange cover to protect our position on
the outstanding contract
Just a minute Forward exchange cover, now what does that mean exactly?
Well, it means that JO Motors enters into a commitment to sell Indian rupees at the present rate
I see. And how will that benefit us
Well, Jo Motors wouldn’t lose out if Indian Rupee falls further
What will it cost, Jane?
A small percentage, about 1% and that can be built into the price of the bike
Well, i don’t suppose there is much choice. All right Jane, let's put it into action.

Charles, among other things, you regarded as one of the America's great masters of the
blues. A musical idiom does essentially about loss, particularly the loss of romantic love.
Why does love die
 People often get into love affairs because they have unrealistic expectations about
somebody Then when the person does’n t turn out to be who they thought he or she was
they start thinking maybe I can change him or her That kind of thinking is a mistake
Because when the dust settles, people are going to be pretty much what they are. it's a rare
thing for anybody to be able to change who they really are. And this creates a lot of
problems.
At 62, you continue to spend a large percentage of your life touring. what appeals to you
about life on the road?
 Music, I don't especially love life on the road, but i figure if you are lucky enough to be
able to do what you truly love doing, you've got the ultimate of life
what's the most widely-held misconception about the life of a famous musician?
 People think it's all glamour. Actually we have the same troubles they do. Playing
music doesn't mean life treats you any better.
How do you feel about being recognized everywhere you go
You think i be used to it by now. But i still find it fascinating You go to a little town in
Japan, where nobody speaks English, yet they know you on side and know all your music.
I’ m still amazed by the love people express for me and by music.

Changing technology and markets have stimulated the team approach to management.
Inflation, resource scarcity, reduced personnel levels and budget cuts have all underscore the
need for better coordination in organizations. Team management provides for this coordination.
Team management calls for new skills if personnel potential is to be fully realized. 
Although a team may be composed of knowledgeable people, they must learn new ways of
relating and working together to solve cross-functional problems. When teams consist to be
experience d employees from hierarchical organizations, who have been condition to traditional
organizational culture. Cooperation may not occur naturally, it mainly to be created.
Furthermore, the issue is not just how the team can function more effectively, but how it
integrates with the overall organization, all society that it supposes it serves. A
group of
individuals is no automatically a team. Therefore, team building may be necessary in order to
improve the group's performance Casey, an expert in this field, suggests that the cooperation
process within teams must be organized, promoted and managed. He believes the team
corporation results when members go beyond their individual capabilities, beyond what each is
used to being and doing Together, the team may then produce something new, unique and
superior to that of any one member. For this to happen, he suggests the multi-cultural
managers exhibit understanding of their own and others' cultural influences and limitations
They should also cultivate such skills as toleration of ambiguity, persistence and patience, as well as assertedness. If a team manager exemplifies such qualities, then the team as a
whole would be better able to realize their potential and achieve their objectives.

n early 1994, when Mark Andreessen was just 23 years old, he arrived in Silicon valley
with an idea that would change the world. As a student at the University of Illinois, he and his friends had developed a program called Mosaic, which allowed people to share information
on the worldwide web. Before Mosaic, the web had been used mainly by scientists and other
technical people, who were happy just to send and receive text. But with Mosaic, Andreessen
and his friends had developed a program, which could send images over the web as well. Mosaic
was an overnight success. It was put on the university’s network at the beginning of 1993. And
by the end of the year, it had over a million users. Soon after, Andreessen went to seek his
fortune in Silicon Valley. Once he got there, he started to have meetings with a man called
Jim Clark, who was one of the valley's most famous entrepreneurs. In 1994, nobody was
making any real money from the Internet, which was still very slow and hard to use. But
Andreessen had seen an opportunity that would make him and Clark rich within two years. He
suggested they should create a new computer program that would do the same job as mosaic
but would be much easier to use. Clark listened carefully to Andreessen, whose ideas and
enthusiasm impressed him greatly.  Eventually, Clark agreed to invest three million dollars
of his own money in the project, and to raise an extra fifteen million from venture capitalists,
who were always keen to listen to clark's new ideas.

Advertising informs consumers about the existence and benefits of products and services
and attempts to persuade them to buy them.  The best form of advertising is probably word
of mouth advertising which occurs when people tell their friends about the benefits of products
or services that they have purchased. Yet virtually no providers of goods or services relay on
this alone, which using paid advertising instead.  Indeed many organizations also use
institutional or prestige advertising which is designed to build up their reputation rather than to
sell particular products.  Although large companies could easily set up their own advertising
departments, write their own advertisements and by media space themselves. they tend to use
the services of large advertising agencies These are likely to have more resources and more
knowledge about all aspects of advertising and advertising media than single company It is also
easier for a dissatisfy company to give its account to another agency. and it would be to fire
their own advertising staff. The company generally give the advertising agency and agreed
budget. a statement of the objective of the advertising campaign know as brief and overall
advertising strategy concerning the message to be communicated to the target customers. The
agency creates advertisements and develops a media prime, specifying which media will be used
and in which proportions.Agencies often produce alternative ads or commercials that
pretested in newspapers, television stations etc in different parts of the country Before a final
choices was made prior to a national campaign
